# The Analysis
Each visualization in this project is tailored to investigate specific aspects of the COVID-19 data. Here's my approach to addressing each question:

### 1. What is the relation between the features and COVID-19 Cases & Deaths ?
![Correlation matrix](assets/Correlation_matrix.png)
![Correlation matrix pairplot](assets/Correlation_matrix_pairplot.png)

The correlation matrix visualizes the relationship between various variables in the dataset. Here's a breakdown of key insights:

#### Strong Correlations:
* __Cases and Deaths (0.86)__: This strong positive correlation indicates that as the number of COVID-19 cases increases, the number of deaths tends to increase as well, which is expected given the nature of the pandemic.

* __Daily Tests and Cases (0.80), Daily Tests and Deaths (0.75)__: These strong positive correlations suggest that regions with more extensive testing report higher numbers of cases and deaths. This may reflect both the spread of the virus and the level of response in terms of testing capacity.

* __Median Age and Population Aged 65 and Over (0.91)__: A strong positive correlation shows that countries with a higher median age typically have a larger percentage of the population aged 65 and over. This relationship underscores demographic patterns related to aging populations.

#### Moderate to Weak Correlations:
* __GDP/Capita and Healthcare Resources__: Moderate positive correlations with hospital beds (0.38) and medical doctors (0.43) per 1000 people suggest that wealthier countries tend to have better healthcare resources. However, the correlation isn't extremely strong, indicating other factors also play significant roles.

* __Population and COVID-19 Metrics__: The population shows moderate positive correlations with Daily Tests (0.50), Cases (0.42), and Deaths (0.38). This indicates that larger populations tend to have higher absolute numbers of tests, cases, and deaths, but the relationship isn't perfectly linear, suggesting effective response measures can mitigate impacts regardless of population size

### 2.1. How have COVID-19 cases and deaths varied month by month across continents?
![Monthly Cases and Deaths by Continent](assets/Monthly_Cases_and_Deaths_by_Continent.png)
__NOTE:__
* 1e7: represents 10,000,000 (10 million).
* 1e8: represents 100,000,000 (100 million).
* 1e9: represents 1,000,000,000 (1 billion).

### 2.2. Monthly Cases and Deaths Globally

### 3. Why the Virus Spread was high in it's earliest stages?
#### __Understanding the peak that occurred between 2020-02 & 2020-04__
![Peak](assets/peak.png)

#### ___Analysis___
* __Global Awareness__: March 2020 is when many governments and populations began to realize the severity of the pandemic, leading to lockdowns and emergency health measures.

* __Lag Effect__: There's typically a lag between case detection, hospitalizations, and deaths, which means the actions (or inactions) in early 2020 began to show their consequences around this time.

* __Rapid Spread__: In the early stages of the pandemic COVID-19 was spreading rapidly across continents, leading to increased fatalities.

### 4. What are the Top 10 Countries with the highest Cases & Deaths?
![Top 10 countries by Cases Deaths](assets/Top_10_countries_by_Cases_Deaths.png)
**Note** : _(The bar chart represents total cases, while the line chart with markers indicates total deaths for these countries)_

#### _**Key Insights**_:
* **Correlation Between Cases and Deaths**: There's a clear visual correlation between the number of reported cases and deaths across these countries. Higher case counts generally correlate with higher death tolls, underscoring the deadly nature of the virus, especially in contexts with overwhelmed healthcare systems or high-risk populations.

* **Variation in Death Rates**: While all top countries have high case numbers, there's noticeable variation in the death rates. Some countries have higher deaths relative to their case counts, which could point to varying levels of healthcare capacity, differences in population demographics, or the effectiveness of the countries' response strategies.

* **Response Measures**: Indirectly, the plot also offers insights into the effectiveness of different countries' response measures. Countries with lower death rates despite high case counts may have had more effective healthcare responses or mitigation strategies.

### 5. How do COVID-19 cases and deaths vary globally?

### 7. Can we predict next month's COVID-19 Cases?

To forecast next month's COVID-19 __Cases__, we've chosen the __Prophet__ model by Facebook, known for handling time series data effectively.

* ### __Step 1:__ Isolating Countries by Continent:

For this task we devided our dataframe to seperate d.fs where each d.f represent a continent (e.g. df_europe = dataframe of europe). the following python script highlights the proccess

```python
# We splitted separate dataframes for each continent
df_continents = {continent: df[df['Continent'] == continent] for continent in df['Continent'].unique()}

# Aggregating dataframe for each continent by date as index, including the mean
df_aggregated = {continent: df.groupby('Date').agg({
    'Cases': 'mean',
    'Deaths': 'mean',
    'Average temperature per year': 'mean',
    'Hospital beds per 1000 people': 'mean',
    'Medical doctors per 1000 people': 'mean',
    'GDP/Capita': 'mean',
    'Population': 'mean',
    'Median age': 'mean',
    'Population aged 65 and over (%)': 'mean'
}).reset_index() for continent, df in df_continents.items()}
for continent, df in df_aggregated.items():
    df_aggregated[continent] = df.set_index('Date')
```

Assigning the aggregated dataframe for each continent:
```python
df_europe = df_aggregated['Europe']
df_asia = df_aggregated['Asia']
df_north_america = df_aggregated['North America']
```
* ### __Step2:__ Model Training 

```python
from prophet import Prophet
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score, mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

def predict_cases_continents(df_dict, n_splits=3):

    for continent, df in df_dict.items():
        df_prophet = df.reset_index().rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Cases': 'y'})
        df_prophet['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(df_prophet['ds'])
        scores_train[continent] = []
        scores_test[continent] = []

        for train_idx, test_idx in tscv.split(df_prophet):
            train = df_prophet.iloc[train_idx]
            test = df_prophet.iloc[test_idx]
            
            # Train the model
            model = Prophet(daily_seasonality='auto', yearly_seasonality='auto', weekly_seasonality='auto')
            model.fit(train)

            # Make predictions on the training set
            forecast_train = model.predict(train[['ds']])
            
            # Make predictions on the test set
            forecast_test = model.predict(test[['ds']])
            
            # Store predictions
            predictions[continent] = {
                'train': forecast_train,
                'test': forecast_test
            }

            # Calculate scores for train set
            y_true_train = train['y']
            y_pred_train = forecast_train['yhat']
            scores_train[continent].append({
                'R2 Score': r2_score(y_true_train, y_pred_train),
                'MSE': mean_squared_error(y_true_train, y_pred_train),
                'MAE': mean_absolute_error(y_true_train, y_pred_train)
            })

            # Calculate scores for test set
            y_true_test = test['y']
            y_pred_test = forecast_test['yhat']
            scores_test[continent].append({
                'R2 Score': r2_score(y_true_test, y_pred_test),
                'MSE': mean_squared_error(y_true_test, y_pred_test),
                'MAE': mean_absolute_error(y_true_test, y_pred_test)
            })

    return predictions, scores_train, scores_test

#### ___Keys dictionary:___

* __trend:__ The underlying trend of the time series data, which is the model's long-term progression.

* __yhat_lower and yhat_upper:__ These are the lower and upper bounds of the forecast's confidence interval. They represent the range within which the actual value is expected to fall, with a certain level of confidence (typically 95%).

* __trend_lower and trend_upper:__ Similar to yhat_lower and yhat_upper, but specifically for the trend component of the model. They provide the confidence interval for the trend estimate.

* __additive_terms:__ Components of the model that are added together to make the final prediction. This could include weekly, yearly, or daily seasonality, as well as holiday effects, depending on the model configuration.

* __additive_terms_lower and additive_terms_upper:__ The lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the additive terms.

* __weekly, weekly_lower, weekly_upper:__ The weekly seasonality effect estimated by the model. The "_lower" and "_upper" refer to the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the weekly component.

* __multiplicative_terms:__ Components that are multiplied by the trend to make the final prediction. This is used when the effect of seasonality grows or shrinks in proportion to the trend.

* __multiplicative_terms_lower and multiplicative_terms_upper:__ The confidence intervals for the multiplicative terms.

* __yhat:__ The final forecasted value. It's the sum of the trend, seasonality, and any other factors the model includes.


 __yhat__ is the final prediction, while __trend__ is just one component of that prediction.
### ___Statistical Insights___

## ___Key Insights___

__Europe:__

* The predictions follow the actual trend closely in both training and testing phases for all splits.

__North America:__

* There's a noticeable overestimation during the early pandemic months, but the model adjusts and aligns closely with the actual cases in subsequent months.

__Asia:__

* For all splits, the test predictions maintain a consistent trend, indicating the model's stability across different time frames.



## __Conclusion__
The predictions indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases increased in each continent during March, suggesting that the virus continued to spread without showing signs of decrease across these regions.


# Summary
